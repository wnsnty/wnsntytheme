# Wnsnty.xyz Theme

This is my personal Bolt CMS 3 theme for my website Wnsnty.XYZ

Whereas the default Bolt CMS 2018 theme uses the Bulma framework for page layout, the Wnsnty.XYZ theme uses Bootstrap 4 for this purpose. Photo gallery support is provided by the Photoswipe plugin.

This theme isn't really designed for use by anyone but myself, as such it missing things that a publically released theme should have. As an example, currently, there is no support for live mode editing.

That said, Wnsnty.XYZ is designed to be modular and easily extendable. Page sections are defined as twig/scss partials and can be removed and extended as needed.

## Usage

Drop into your themes folder. Since only SCSS files are included, you must compile wnsnty.css by running css/source through SASS compiler.

## Wnsnty.xyz uses the following third party libraries:
Bootstrap: getboostrap.com
PhotoSwipe: dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe
Lazysizes:  aFarkas/lazysizes
Highlightjs:  highlightjs/highlight.js
